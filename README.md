## Installation 
This application does not run in the browser and so the user will have to clone the code from GitHub and then using an application, such as Visual Studio Code or Git, the user will need to type "npm init -y", and then "npm install". The application should now be ready to use.
                
## Usage 
To begin using the application, the user must open the application that has been installed from GitHub, following the instructions in the "installation" section above. Then, they must open an integrated terminal and type "node index.js". Prompts will appear in the terminal for the user to answer. Once the prompts have been completed, the user will see a file called "README.md" appear in the same folder as the application that has been downloaded from GitHub. They can then copy this to their own application for use.
